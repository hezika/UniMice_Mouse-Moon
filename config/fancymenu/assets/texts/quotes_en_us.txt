“The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”
No task will seem impossible if you break it down into parts.
The best way to cheer yourself up is to cheer someone else up.
If you are lazy and persistent, you will certainly achieve something.
I am not what happened to me, I am what I decided to become.
Life is actually simple, but people persistently complicate it.
Victory is not everything, everything is a constant desire to win.
Everything has its own beauty, but not everyone can see it.
Failure is simply an opportunity to start again, but more wisely.
Remember that not achieving success is sometimes also great luck.
The only happiness in life is constant striving forward.
